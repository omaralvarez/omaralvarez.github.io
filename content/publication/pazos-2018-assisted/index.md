abstract: This research study explores the use of point clouds for design geometrically complex surfaces based on genetic morphogenesis. To this end, a point-based genetic algorithm and the use of massive unstructured point clouds are proposed as a manipulation method of complex geometries. The intent of the algorithm is to improve the design experience, thus different solutions can be presented to designers. The main objective of this work is to provide examples to be adopted as user own or to help them in the creative process. This is not about providing them with a tool to do the designer creative work, but using it as a creative tool in which the user retains control of it. The powerfulness of this approach relies on the fact that the user can use any/diverse criteria (objective or subjective) to evaluate the individuals proposed as possible solutions. As part of this study, the convergence of the algorithm and the ability of diversity in the final populations of the search process will be demonstrated. Various examples of the use of the algorithm are displayed.
